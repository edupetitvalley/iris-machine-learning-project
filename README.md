## 🎯 Objectives

- Understand the structure and patterns of the Iris dataset  
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
- Build and compare machine learning models  
- Evaluate model performance using standard metrics  
- Interpret results and extract insights  

---

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The EDA phase includes:

- Summary statistics  
- Distribution analysis  
- Correlation structure  
- Pairwise scatter plots  
- Class separability  
- Outlier detection  

This step provides the analytical foundation before modeling.

## 🤖 Machine Learning Models

The project includes one or more supervised learning algorithms, such as:

- Logistic Regression  
- k‑Nearest Neighbors  
- Decision Trees  
- Random Forest  
- Support Vector Machines  

Models are compared using:

- Accuracy  
- Precision / Recall  
- Confusion Matrix  
- Cross‑validation

## 🧠 Key Insights

- Which features best separate the three Iris species  
- How simple vs. complex models perform  
- Which model generalizes best  
- Interpretation of decision boundaries
